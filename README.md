This is a simple React application that integrates a calendar component using the `react-calendar` library. It allows users to select a date from the calendar and displays the selected date below the calendar. 

Here’s a breakdown of the code:

### Key Features:
1. **State Management**:
   - The `useState` hook is used to manage the selected date (`date`). The state is initialized with the current date (`new Date()`).
   - `changeDate` is the setter function used to update the state when a new date is selected.

2. **Calendar Component**:
   - The `Calendar` component from `react-calendar` is imported and rendered inside a `div` element.
   - The `onChange` prop is passed to the `Calendar` component, which triggers the `changeValue` function whenever a user selects a date.
   - The `value` prop is set to the current state `date`, which ensures the calendar reflects the selected date.

3. **Date Display**:
   - Below the calendar, the currently selected date is displayed using `date.toLocaleDateString()`, which converts the selected date into a human-readable format (e.g., "12/25/2024").

4. **Custom Styling**:
   - The `styles.css` file is imported to apply custom CSS for styling the calendar and the rest of the application.
   - The `app-container` and `calendar-container` classes provide basic layout and styling for the page.

### How It Works:
- When the app is loaded, the calendar shows the current month and date.
- When a user clicks on a specific date on the calendar, it updates the `date` state with the new date.
- The selected date is then displayed below the calendar in the format `MM/DD/YYYY` (depending on the browser locale).

### Example Output:
- The calendar will display a monthly view with days of the month.
- Below the calendar, you’ll see a message like: `The selected date is: 12/25/2024`.

### Potential Enhancements:
- You could customize the calendar further by adding features like event handling for specific dates, holiday markings, or integrating external data (like birthdays or appointments) to display on specific dates.
